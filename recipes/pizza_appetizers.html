    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Similar to meat-filled calzones, these cheesy little swirls were invented
      during football season. The name was inspired by our favorite team.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated pizza crust dough</li>
      <li>¼ pound Genoa salami, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>¼ pound pepperoni sausage, sliced</li>
      <li>¼ pound provolone cheese, sliced</li>
      <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>

      <li>
        Roll pizza crust dough into an approximately 10x14 inch rectangle on the

        Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese to within 1/2 inch from edges of the
        dough. Roll jelly roll style. Seal the edge with a fork.
